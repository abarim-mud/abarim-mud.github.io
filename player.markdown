## Creating Account and Character

## Starting Up: Movement, Recall, First Command
AbarimMUD is 6-direction MUD(north, south, east, west, up, down).

Check the [cartography](/cartography.html) section.
You'll start in the Northern Midgaard in the room "The Temple Of Midgaard" (#3001).

You could always return to that room using command `recall`, which requires 35 mana.

It makes sense to do `fightskill kick` right after entering the game.
It'll make the character automatically kick enemies every round during a fight.
You could turn it off using command `fightskill off`

## Combat
AbarimMUD is hack'n'slash game: you kill stuff for the experience and watch the numbers grow.

So in order to start this activity go `4n, e`(area `Newbie Zone`) and initiate a fight with the newbie monster.

You could it multiple ways. The most obvious way is through command `kill monster`.
However if you're playing a Rogue, then it makes sense to start the fight with backstab (`ba monster`).
